/// @assertion The C unsigned long int, aka. unsigned long, type.
///
/// Typically an unsigned 32- or 64-bit integer. For a guaranteed 32-bit
/// integer, use [Uint32] with the C uint32_t type. For a guaranteed 64-bit
/// integer, use [Uint64] with the C uint64_t type. For a signed long, use
/// [Long].
///
/// The [UnsignedLong] type is a native type, and should not be constructed in
/// Dart code. It occurs only in native type signatures and as annotation on
/// [Struct] and [Union] fields.

/// @description Checks that this type is an unsigned 32- or 64-bit integer.
