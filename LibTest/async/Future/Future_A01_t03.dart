/// @assertion Future(dynamic computation())
/// Creates a future containing the result of calling computation
/// asynchronously with Timer.run.
/// if the result of executing computation throws, the returned future is
/// completed with the error.
/// If the returned value is itself a Future, completion of the created
/// future will wait until the returned future completes, and will then
