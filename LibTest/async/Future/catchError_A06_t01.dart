/// @assertion Future catchError(Function onError, {bool test(Object error)})
///    If this future completes with an error, then test is first called with
/// the error value.
///    If test returns false, the exception is not handled by this catchError,
/// and the returned future completes with the same error and stack trace as

///    If test returns true, onError is called with the error and possibly stack
/// trace, and the returned future is completed with the result of this call in

/// The test function should not throw, but if it does, it is handled as if
