/// @assertion Future cancel()
/// Cancels the stream iterator (and the underlying stream subscription) early.
///
/// The stream iterator is automatically canceled if the moveNext future
/// completes with either false or an error.
///
/// If you need to stop listening for values before the stream iterator is
/// automatically closed, you must call cancel to ensure that the stream is
/// properly closed.
///
/// If moveNext has been called when the iterator is cancelled, its returned
/// future will complete with false as value, as will all further calls to
/// moveNext.
///
/// Returns a future if the cancel-operation is not completed synchronously.
/// Otherwise returns null.
///
/// @description Checks that call to cancel() makes subsequent call to moveNext()
