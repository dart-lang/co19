/// @assertion Future<T> firstWhere (
///  bool test(T element), {@deprecated dynamic defaultValue(), T orElse()})
///
/// Finds the first element of this stream matching test.
///
/// Returns a future that is completed with the first element of this stream that
/// test returns true for.
///
/// If no such element is found before this stream is done, and a orElse function
/// is provided, the result of calling orElse becomes the value of the future. If
/// orElse throws, the returned future is completed with that error.
///
/// If this stream emits an error before the first matching element, the returned
/// future is completed with that error, and processing stops.
///
/// Stops listening to the stream after the first matching element or error has
/// been received.
///
/// Internally the method cancels its subscription after the first element that
/// matches the predicate. This means that single-subscription (non-broadcast)
/// streams are closed and cannot be reused after a call to this method.
///
/// If an error occurs, or if this stream ends without finding a match and with
/// no orElse function provided, the returned future is completed with an error.
///
/// The defaultValue parameter is deprecated, and orElse should be used instead.
/// @description Checks that if this stream ends without finding a match and an
/// orElse function is provided, then the result of calling orElse becomes
/// the value of the future.
