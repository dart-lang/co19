/// @assertion Iterator<E> iterator
/// Returns a new Iterator that allows iterating the elements of this Iterable.
/// Iterable classes may specify the iteration order of their elements (for
/// example List always iterate in index order), or they may leave it unspecified
/// (for example a hash-based Set may iterate in any order).
///
/// Each time iterator is read, it returns a new iterator, which can be used to
/// iterate through all the elements again. The iterators of the same iterable
/// can be stepped through independently, but should return the same elements in
/// the same order, as long as the underlying collection isn't changed.
///
/// Modifying the collection may cause new iterators to produce different
/// elements, and may change the order of existing elements. A List specifies its
/// iteration order precisely, so modifying the list changes the iteration order
/// predictably. A hash-based Set may change its iteration order completely when
/// adding a new element to the set.
///
/// Modifying the underlying collection after creating the new iterator may cause
/// an error the next time Iterator.moveNext is called on that iterator. Any
/// modifiable iterable class should specify which operations will break
/// iteration.
/// @description Checks that iterator iterates all elements of this Iterable.
/// Test not empty collection
