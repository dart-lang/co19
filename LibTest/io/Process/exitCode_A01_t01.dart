/// @assertion Future<int> exitCode
///
/// Returns a Future which completes with the exit code of the process when the
/// process completes.
///
/// The handling of exit codes is platform specific.
///
/// On Linux and OS X a normal exit code will be a positive value in the range
/// 0..255. If the process was terminated due to a signal the exit code will be
/// a negative value in the range -255..-1, where the absolute value of the exit
/// code is the signal number. For example, if a process crashes due to a
/// segmentation violation the exit code will be -11, as the signal SIGSEGV has
/// the number 11.
///
/// On Windows a process can report any 32-bit value as an exit code. When
/// returning the exit code this exit code is turned into a signed value. Some
/// special values are used to report termination due to some system event. E.g.
/// if a process crashes due to an access violation the 32-bit exit code is
/// 0xc0000005, which will be returned as the negative number -1073741819. To get
/// the original 32-bit value use (0x100000000 + exitCode) & 0xffffffff.
///
/// @description Checks that [exitCode] returns a Future which completes with the
/// exit code of the process when the process completes. On Linux and OS X a
/// normal exit code will be a positive value in the range 0..255.
