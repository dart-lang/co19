/**
 * @assertion Future<HttpClientRequest> open(
 *  String method,
 *  String host,
 *  int port,
 *  String path
 *  )
 * Opens a HTTP connection.
 *
 * The HTTP method to use is specified in method, the server is specified using
 * host and port, and the path (including a possible query) is specified using
 * path. The path may also contain a URI fragment, which will be ignored.
 *
 * The Host header for the request will be set to the value host:port. This can
 * be overridden through the HttpClientRequest interface before the request is
 * sent. NOTE if host is an IP address this will still be set in the Host
 * header.
 *
 * For additional information on the sequence of events during an HTTP
 * transaction, and the objects returned by the futures, see the overall
 * documentation for the class HttpClient.
 * @description Checks that this method opens a HTTP connection using the
 * specified arguments and path may contain query and ignored URI fragment
