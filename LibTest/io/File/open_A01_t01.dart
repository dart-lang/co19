/// @assertion Future<RandomAccessFile> open({FileMode mode: FileMode.read})
/// Open the file for random access operations. Returns a
/// Future<RandomAccessFile> that completes with the opened random access file.
/// RandomAccessFiles must be closed using the RandomAccessFile.close method.
///
/// Files can be opened in three modes:
/// FileMode.read: open the file for reading.
/// FileMode.write: open the file for both reading and writing and truncate the
/// file to length zero. If the file does not exist the file is created.
///
/// FileMode.append: same as FileMode.write except that the file is not
/// truncated.
/// @description Checks that this method returns a Future<RandomAccessFile> that
/// completes with the opened random access file
