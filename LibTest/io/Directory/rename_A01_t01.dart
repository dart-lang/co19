/// @assertion Future<Directory> rename(String newPath)
/// Renames this directory. Returns a Future<Directory> that completes with a
/// Directory instance for the renamed directory.
///
/// If [newPath] identifies an existing directory, then the behavior is
/// platform-specific. On all platforms, a [FileSystemException] is thrown
/// if the existing directory is not empty. On POSIX systems, if [newPath]
/// identifies an existing empty directory then that directory is deleted
/// before this directory is renamed.
///
/// If newPath identifies an existing file or link the operation fails and a
/// [FileSystemException] is thrown.
///
/// @note Shortly:
/// - [File]/[Link] `rename/renameSync` can replace other [File]/[Link] but not
///   [Directory]
/// - [Directory] `rename/renameSync` can not replace an existing
///   [File]/[Link]/[Directory] except on POSIX where it can replace an empty
///   [Directory]
///
/// @description Checks that this method returns a `Future<Directory>` that
/// completes with a [Directory] instance for the renamed directory.
