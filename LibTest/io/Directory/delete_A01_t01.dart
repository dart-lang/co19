/// @assertion Future<FileSystemEntity> delete({bool recursive: false})
/// Deletes this FileSystemEntity.
///
/// If the FileSystemEntity is a directory, and if recursive is false, the
/// directory must be empty. Otherwise, if recursive is true, the directory and
/// all sub-directories and files in the directories are deleted. Links are not
/// followed when deleting recursively. Only the link is deleted, not its target.
///
/// If recursive is true, the FileSystemEntity is deleted even if the type of the
/// FileSystemEntity doesn't match the content of the file system. This behavior
/// allows delete to be used to unconditionally delete any file system object.
///
/// Returns a Future<FileSystemEntity> that completes with this FileSystemEntity
/// when the deletion is done. If the FileSystemEntity cannot be deleted, the
/// future completes with an exception.
/// @description Checks that this method deletes this FileSystemEntity and
/// returns a Future<FileSystemEntity> that completes with this FileSystemEntity
