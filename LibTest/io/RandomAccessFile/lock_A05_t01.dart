/// NOTE file locking does have slight differences in behavior across platforms:

/// On Linux and OS X this uses advisory locks, which have the surprising
/// semantics that all locks associated with a given file are removed when any
/// file descriptor for that file is closed by the process. Note that this does
/// not actually lock the file for access. Also note that advisory locks are on
/// a process level. This means that several isolates in the same process can
/// obtain an exclusive lock on the same file.
///
/// On Windows the regions used for lock and unlock needs to match. If that is
/// not the case unlocking will result in the OS error "The segment is already
/// unlocked".
