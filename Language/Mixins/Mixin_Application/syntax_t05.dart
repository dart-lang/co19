/// @assertion Let S be a class, M be a mixin with required superinterfaces
/// T1, . . . , Tn, combined superinterface MS, implemented interfaces
/// I1, . . . , Ik and members as mixin member declarations, and let N be a name.

/// The mixin application of M to S with name N introduces a new class, C,
