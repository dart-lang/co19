/// @assertion The effect of a class definition of the form class C = M; or the
/// form class C<T1,...,Tn> = M; in library L is to introduce the name C into
/// the scope of L, bound to the class defined by the mixin application M.
/// The name of the class is also set to C. Iff the class is prefixed by the
/// built-in identifier abstract, the class being defined is an abstract class.
/// @description Checks that class C is not abstract (can be instantiated by
/// new) if there are no abstract identifier but M in S with M is abstract
/// @author sgrekhov@unipro.ru

// TODO(https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/51557): Decide if the mixins
