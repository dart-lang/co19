/// @assertion A clause of the form S with M1, ..., Mn with name N defines a
/// class as follows:
/// If there is only one mixin (n = 1), then S with M1 defines the class yielded
/// by the mixin application of the mixin of M1 to the class denoted by S with
/// name N.
/// If there is more than one mixin (n > 1), then let X be the class defined by
/// S with M1, ..., Mnâˆ’1 with name F, where F is a fresh name, and make X
/// abstract. Then S with M1, ..., Mn defines the class yielded by the mixin
/// application of the mixin of Mn to the class X with name N.
/// In either case, let K be a class declaration with the same constructors,
/// superclass, interfaces and instance members as the defined class. It is a
/// compile-time error if the declaration of K would cause a compile-time error.
