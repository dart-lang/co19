/// @assertion Execution of a statement s of the form yield* e; proceeds as
/// follows:
///    First, the expression e is evaluated to an object o.
///    If the immediately enclosing function m is marked sync*, then:
/// 1. It is a dynamic error if the class of o does not implement Iterable.
/// Otherwise
/// 2. The method iterator is invoked upon o returning an object i.
/// 3. The moveNext method of i is invoked on it with no arguments. If moveNext
/// returns false execution of s is complete. Otherwise
/// 4. The getter current is invoked on i. If the invocation raises an
/// exception ex, execution of s throws ex. Otherwise, the result x of the
/// getter invocation is added to the iterable associated with m. Execution of
/// the function m immediately enclosing s is suspended until the nullary method
/// moveNext() is invoked upon the iterator used to initiate the current
/// invocation of m, at which point execution of s continues at 3.
/// 5. The current call to moveNext() returns true.
///
/// @description Check that value x, obtained via getter current, is added to
