/// @assertion Execution of a for statement of the form for (var v = e0; c; e) s
/// proceeds as follows:
/// If c is empty then let c' be true otherwise let c' be c.
/// First the variable declaration statement var v = e0 is executed. Then:
/// 1. If this is the first iteration of the for loop, let v' be v. Otherwise,
///    let v' be the variable v'' created in the previous execution of step 4.
/// 2. The expression [v'/v]c is evaluated and subjected to boolean conversion.
///    If the result is false, the for loop completes. Otherwise, execution
///    continues at step 3.
/// 3. The statement [v'/v]s is executed.
/// 4. Let v'' be a fresh variable. v'' is bound to the value of v'.
/// 5. The expression [v''/v]e is evaluated, and the process recurses at step 1.
/// @description Checks that there're indeed distinct iteration variables for
/// every iteration of the loop by creating a closure for each one and calling
/// it after the loop completes.
