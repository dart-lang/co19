/// @assertion Dart supports two levels of privacy: public and private. 
/// A declaration is private iff its name is private, otherwise it is public.
/// A name q is private iff any one of the identifiers that comprise q is 
/// private, otherwise it is public.
/// An identifier is private iff it begins with an underscore (the _ character) 
/// otherwise it is public.
/// A declaration m is accessible to library L if m is declared in L or if m is 
/// public.
/// @description Checks that type parameter names can begin with an underscore 
/// and are still accessible in the appropriate scope.
