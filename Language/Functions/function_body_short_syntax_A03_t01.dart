/// @assertion A function body is either:
/// ...
/// - of the form `=> e` or the form `async => e`, which both return the value
///   of the expression `e` as if by a `return e`. ...  Let `T` be the declared
///   return type of the function that has this body. It is a compile-time error
///   if one of the following conditions hold:
///   â€“ The function is synchronous, `T` is not `void`, and it would have been a
///     compile-time error to declare the function with the body `{ return e; }`
///     rather than `=> e`.
///
/// @description Checks that it is not an error to declare a synchronous
/// function with a short syntax and the return type `void`.
