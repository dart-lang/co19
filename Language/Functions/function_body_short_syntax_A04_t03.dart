/// @assertion A function body is either:
/// ...
/// - of the form `=> e` or the form `async => e`, which both return the value
///   of the expression `e` as if by a `return e`. ...  Let `T` be the declared
///   return type of the function that has this body. It is a compile-time error
///   if one of the following conditions hold:
///   ...
///   â€“ The function is asynchronous, `flatten(T)` is not `void`, and it would
///     have been a compile-time error to declare the function with the body
///     `async { return e; }` rather than `async => e`.

/// @description Checks that it is not an error to declare an asynchronous
/// method with return type `T`, with a short syntax and `flatten(T)` is `void`.
