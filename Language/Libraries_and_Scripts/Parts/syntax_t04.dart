/// @assertion A library may be divided into parts, each of which can be stored
/// in a separate location. A library identifies its parts by listing them via
/// part directives.
/// A part directive specifies a URI where a Dart compilation unit that should
/// be incorporated into the current library may be found.
/// partDirective:
///   metadata part uri ';'
/// ;
/// partHeader:
///   metadata part of identifier (‘.’ identifier)* ‘;’
/// ;
/// partDeclaration:
///   partHeader topLevelDefinition* EOF
/// ;
/// A part header begins with part of followed by the name of the library the
/// part belongs to. A part declaration consists of a part header followed by a
/// sequence of top-level declarations.
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if a part directive
/// begins with a '#' character.
