/// @assertion If a name N is referenced by a library L and N is introduced into
/// the top level scope L by more than one import, and not all the imports denote
/// the same declaration, then:
/// • A static warning occurs.
/// • If N is referenced as a function, getter or setter, a NoSuchMethodError is
///   raised.
/// • If N is referenced as a type, it is treated as a malformed type.
/// It is neither an error nor a warning if N is introduced by two or more
/// imports but never referred to.
/// @description Checks that it is neither error nor warning if a library
/// imports two other libraries exporting the same name (both via re-export of a
/// third library), references that name in an explicit type test and other
/// expressions, but it's hidden in one of the import declarations of L (so
/// there's actually no name clash).
