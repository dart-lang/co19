///  • T is S.
///  • T is ⊥
///  • S is dynamic.
///  • S is a direct supertype of T.
///  • T is a type parameter and S is the upper bound of T.
///  • T is a type parameter and S is Object.
///  • T is of the form I<T1, ..., Tn > and S is of the form I <S1, ..., Sn>
///    and Ti << Si 1 <= i <= n.
///  • T and S are both function types, and T << S under the rules of section
///    (Types/Function Types).
///  • T is a function type and S is Function.
///  • T << U and U << S.
/// << is a partial order on types. T is a subtype of S, written T <: S, iff
/// [⊥/Dynamic]T << S.

/// An interface type T may be assigned to a type S, written T <=> S, if either
/// T <: S or S <: T.

/// not a subtype of List<String> and vice versa even though List is a subtype
/// of both and both are subtypes of List.
