/// @assertion Let T be a parameterized type G < S1, ..., Sn >. If G is not a
/// generic type, the type arguments Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ n are discarded. If G has
/// m <> n type parameters, T is treated as as a parameterized type with m
/// arguments, all of which are dynamic.
/// In short, any arity mismatch results in all type arguments being dropped,
/// and replaced with the correct number of type arguments, all set to dynamic.
/// Of course, a static warning will be issued.
/// @description Checks that if G is not a generic type, the type arguments
/// cause compile error
