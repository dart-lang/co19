/// @assertion Execution of a generative constructor k is always done with
/// respect to a set of bindings for its formal parameters and with this bound
/// to a fresh instance i and the type parameters of the immediately enclosing
/// class bound to a set of actual type arguments V1, ... , Vm.
/// If k is redirecting then its redirect clause has the form
///   this.g(a1, ..., an, xn+1: an+1, ..., xn+k: an+k)
/// where g identifies another generative constructor of the immediately
/// surrounding class. Then execution of k proceeds by evaluating the argument
/// list (a1, ..., an, xn+1: an+1, ..., xn+k: an+k) and then executing g with
/// respect to the bindings resulting from the evaluation of (a1, ..., an, xn+1:
/// an+1, ..., xn+k: an+k) and with this bound to i and the type parameters of
/// the immediately enclosing class bound to V1, ... , Vm.
/// Otherwise, execution  proceeds as follows:
/// Any initializing formals declared in k's parameter list are executed in the
/// order they appear in the program text. Then, k's initializers are executed
/// in the order they appear in the program.
/// After all the initializers have completed, the body of k is executed in a
/// scope where this is bound to i. Execution of the body begins with execution
/// of the body of the superconstructor with this bound to i, the type
/// parameters of the immediately enclosing class bound to a set of actual type
/// arguments V1, ... , Vm and the formal parameter bindings determined by the
/// argument list of the superinitializer of k.
/// @description Checks that superconstructor initializers and superconstructor
/// body are executed in the correct order and before the body of this class's
/// constructor.
