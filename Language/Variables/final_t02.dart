/// @assertion A final variable is a variable whose binding is fixed upon
/// initialization; a final variable v will always refer to the same object
/// after v has been initialized. The declaration of a final variable must
/// include the modifier final.
/// It is a static warning if a final instance variable that has been
/// initialized at its point of declaration is also initialized in a
/// constructor.
/// It is a compile-time error if a local variable v is final and v is not
/// initialized at its point of declaration.
/// @description Checks that a compile error occurs if a final instance
/// variable that has been initialized in declaration is also initialized in
/// a constructor.
