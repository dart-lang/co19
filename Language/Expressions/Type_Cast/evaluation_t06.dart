/// @assertion Evaluation of the cast expression e as T proceeds as follows:
/// The expression e is evaluated to a value v.
/// Then, if T is malformed or deferred type, a dynamic error occurs.
/// Otherwise, if the interface of the class of v is a subtype of T, the cast
/// expression evaluates to v.
/// Otherwise, if v is null, the cast expression evaluates to v.
/// In all other cases, a CastError is thrown.
/// @description Checks that if T is a parameterized type of the form
/// G<T1,...,Tn> and G is generic type with different number of parameters, then
/// T is not malformed (see Types/Parameterized Types) and CastError is thrown,
