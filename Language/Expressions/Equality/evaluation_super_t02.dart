/// @assertion Evaluation of an equality expression ee of the form super == e
/// proceeds as follows:
/// • The expression e is evaluated to an object o.
/// • If either this or o is null, then ee evaluates to evaluates to true if both
///   this and o are null and to false otherwise. Otherwise ee is equivalent to
///   the method invocation super.==(o).
/// @description Checks that if nnbd is turned on and [o] is [null], the operator
/// super [==(o)] is called and no exception is thrown.
