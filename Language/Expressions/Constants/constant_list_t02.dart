/// @assertion A constant expression is an expression whose value can never
/// change, and that can be evaluated entirely at compile time.
/// A constant expression is one of the following:
/// . . .
/// â€¢ A constant list literal, const <T>[e1, ..., en], or <T>[e1,..., en] that
///   occurs in a constant context, is a potentially constant expression if T is
///   a constant type expression, and e1, . . . , en are constant expressions.
///   It is further a constant expression if the list literal evaluates to an
///   object.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if in a constant list
/// literal of the form const `<T>[e1, ..., en]`, or `<T>[e1, ..., en]`, `T` is
/// not a constant type expression
