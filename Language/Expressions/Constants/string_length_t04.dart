/// @assertion The potentially constant expressions and constant expressions are
/// the following:
/// ...
/// â€¢ An expression of the form `e.length` is potentially constant if `e` is a
///   potentially constant expression. It is further constant if `e` is a
///   constant expression that evaluates to an instance of [String], such that
///   `length` denotes an instance getter invocation.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to use a null-aware
/// operator `?.` in a constant `String.length` expression.
