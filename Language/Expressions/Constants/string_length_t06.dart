/// @assertion The potentially constant expressions and constant expressions are

/// â€¢ An expression of the form `e?.length` is potentially constant if `e` is a
///   potentially constant expression. It is further constant if `e` is a
///   constant expression that evaluates to `null`, or it evaluates to an
///   instance of `String` and `length` denotes an instance getter invocation.
