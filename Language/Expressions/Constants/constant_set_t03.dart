/// @assertion A potentially constant expression is an expression that will
/// generally yield a constant value when the values of certain parameters are
/// given. The constant expressions is a subset of the potentially constant
/// expressions that can be evaluated at compile time.
/// ...
/// The potentially constant expressions and constant expressions are the
/// following:
/// ...
/// â€¢ A constant set literal, const <T>{e1, ..., en}, or <T>{e1, ..., en} that
///   occurs in a constant context, is a potentially constant expression if T is
///   a constant type expression, and e1, . . . , en are constant expressions.
///   It is further a constant expression if the set literal evaluates to an
///   object.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if in a constant set
/// literal of the form `const <T>{e1, ..., en}`, or `<T>{e1, ..., en}`, any of
/// `ei` is not a constant expression
