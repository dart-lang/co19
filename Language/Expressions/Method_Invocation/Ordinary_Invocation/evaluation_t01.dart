/// @assertion Evaluation of an unconditional ordinary method invocation i of
/// the form o.m(a1 , ..., an , xn+1 : an+1 , ..., xn+k : an+k)
/// proceeds as follows:
/// First, the expression o is evaluated to a value vo. Next, the argument list
/// (a1, ..., an, xn+1 : an+1, ..., xn+k : an+k) is evaluated yielding actual
/// argument objects o1, ..., on+k. Let f be the result of looking up method m
/// in vo with respect to the current library L.
/// Let p1 ... ph be the required parameters of f, let p1 ... pm be the
/// positional parameters of f and let ph+1, ..., ph+l be the named parameters
/// declared by f.
/// If n < h, or n > m, the method lookup has failed. Furthermore, each
/// xi , n + 1 <= i <= n + k, must have a corresponding named parameter in the
/// set {ph+1 , ..., ph+l} or the method lookup also fails. If vo is an instance
/// of Type but o is not a constant type literal, then if m is a method that
/// forwards to a static method, method lookup fails. Otherwise method lookup
/// has succeeded.
/// If the method lookup succeeded, the body of f is executed with respect to
/// the bindings that resulted from the evaluation of the argument list, and
/// with this bound to vo. The value of i is the value returned after f is
/// executed.
/// @description Checks that first the expression o is evaluated and then
/// expressions in the argument list in order from left to right.
