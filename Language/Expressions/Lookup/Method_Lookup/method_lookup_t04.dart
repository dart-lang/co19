/// @assertion The result of a lookup of method m in class C with respect to
/// library L is: If C declares a concrete instance method named m that is
/// accessible to L, then that method is the result of the lookup, and we say
/// that the method was looked up in c. Otherwise, if C has a superclass S, then
/// the result of the lookup is the result of looking up m in S with respect to
/// L. Otherwise, we say that the method lookup has failed.
