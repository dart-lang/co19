 * @assertion Let c1 and c2 be a pair of constants. Then identical(c1, c2) iff:
 * - c1 evaluates to either null, a constant map, an constant list, an instance
 *   of bool, num, String and c1 == c2 , OR
 * - c1 and c2 are constant objects of the same class C and for each member
 *   field of c1 is identical to the corresponding field of c2 .
 * where identical() is the predefined dart function that returns true iff its two
 * arguments are either:
 *  • The same object.
 *  • Of type int and have the same numeric value.
 *  • Of type double, are not NaNs and have the same numeric value.
 * @description Checks that two constants are identical iff they are equal.
