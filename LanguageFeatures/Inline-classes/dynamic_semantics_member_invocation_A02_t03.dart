/// @assertion Consider an invocation of the inline member m on the receiver e
/// according to the inline type V and with actual type arguments T1, ..., Ts.
/// If the invocation includes an actual argument part (possibly including some
/// actual type arguments) then call it args. Assume that V declares the type
/// variables X1, ..., Xs.
///
/// Let Dm be the declaration named m thath V has.
///
/// Evaluation of this invocation proceeds by evaluating e to an object o.
/// ...
/// Otherwise, if args is omitted and Dm is a method, the invocation evaluates
/// to a closurization of Dm where this and the name of the representation are
/// bound to o, and the type variables of V are bound to the actual values of
/// T1, .. Ts. The operator == of the closurization returns true if and only if
/// the operand is the same object.
