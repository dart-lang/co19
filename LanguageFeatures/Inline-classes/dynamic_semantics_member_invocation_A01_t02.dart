/// @assertion Consider an invocation of the extension type member m on the
/// receiver expression e according to the extension type declaration V with
/// actual type arguments T1, ..., Ts. If the invocation includes an actual
/// argument part (possibly including some actual type arguments) then call it
/// args. If the invocation omits args, but includes a list of actual type
/// arguments then call them typeArgs. Assume that V declares the type variables
/// X1, ..., Xs
/// ...
/// Let Dm be the unique declaration named m that V has.
///
/// Evaluation of this invocation proceeds by evaluating e to an object o.
///
/// Then, if args is omitted and Dm is a getter, execute the body of said getter
/// in an environment where this is bound to o and the representation name
/// denotes a getter that returns o, and the type variables of V are bound to
/// the actual values of T1, .. Ts. If the body completes returning an object o2
/// then the invocation evaluates to o2. If the body throws an object and a
/// stack trace then the invocation completes throwing the same object and stack
/// trace.
///
/// @description Check invocation of an extension type getter in the case when
/// type arguments are omitted. Test that if the body throws an object and a
/// stack trace then the invocation completes throwing the same object and stack
/// trace
