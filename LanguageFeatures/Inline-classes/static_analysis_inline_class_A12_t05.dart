/// @assertion Let DV be an inline class declaration named Inline with type
/// parameters X1 extends B1, .. Xs extends Bs. Assume that DV declares a final
/// instance variable with name id and type R.
///
/// We say that the declared representation type of Inline is R, and the
/// instantiated representation type corresponding to Inline<T1,.. Ts> is
/// [T1/X1, .. Ts/Xs]R.
/// ...
/// Let V be an inline type of the form Inline<T1, .. Ts>, and let R be the
/// corresponding instantiated representation type. If R is non-nullable then V
/// is a proper subtype of Object, and V is non-nullable. Otherwise, V is a
/// proper subtype of Object?, and V is potentially nullable.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to have an instance
/// variable whose type is an inline type, and then relying on implicit
/// initialization to null.
