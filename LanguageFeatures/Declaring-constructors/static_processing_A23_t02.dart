/// @assertion The semantics of the declaring constructor is found in the
/// following steps, where `D` is the class, extension type, or enum declaration
/// in the program that includes a declaring constructor `k`, and `D2` is the
/// result of the derivation of the semantics of `D`. The derivation step will
/// delete elements that amount to the declaring constructor. Semantically, it
/// will add a new constructor `k2`, and it will add zero or more instance
/// variable declarations.
/// ...
/// Otherwise, a formal parameter (named or positional) of the form` var T p` or
/// `final T p` where `T` is a type and `p` is an identifier is replaced in `L2`
/// by `this.p`, along with its default value, if any. Next, a semantic instance
/// variable declaration corresponding to the syntax `T p;` or `final T p;` is
/// added to `D2`. It includes the modifier `final` if the parameter in `L` has
/// the modifier `final`, or `D` is an extension type declaration and `k` is a
/// declaring header constructor. In all cases, if `p` has the modifier
/// `covariant` then this modifier is removed from the parameter in `L2`, and it
/// is added to the instance variable declaration named `p`.
///
/// @description Check that it is a compile-time error if a declaring
/// constructor contains two formal parameters with the same name.
/// Test declaring vs. super parameters.
