/// @assertion The following applies to both the header and the body form of
/// declaring constructors.
///
/// The semantics of the declaring constructor is found in the following steps,
/// where `D` is the class, extension type, or enum declaration in the program
/// that includes a declaring constructor, and `D2` is the result of the
/// derivation of the semantics of `D`. The derivation step will delete elements
/// that amount to the declaring constructor; it will add a new constructor `k`;
/// and it will add zero or more instance variable declarations.
///
/// Where no processing is mentioned below, `D2` is identical to `D`. Changes
/// occur as follows:
///
/// Let `p` be a formal parameter in `k` which has the modifier `var` or the
/// modifier `final` (that is, `p` is a declaring parameter).
///
/// Consider the situation where `p` has no type annotation:
/// ...
/// - otherwise, if `p` is optional and has a default value whose static type in
///   the empty context is a type `T` which is not `Null` then `p` has declared
///   type `T`. When `T` is `Null`, `p` has declared type `Object?`.
///
/// @description Check that if `p` does not have a declared type, but it does
/// have a default value whose static type is `T` which is not `Null` then `p`
/// has the declared type `T`.
