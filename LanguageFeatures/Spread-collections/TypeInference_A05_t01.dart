/**
 * @assertion From the Unified collections Spec:
 * We require that at least one component unambiguously determine the literal
 * form, otherwise it is a compile-time error. So, given:
 *    dynamic x = <int, int>{};
 *    Iterable l = [];
 *    Map m = {};
 *    Then:
 *    {...x}       // Static error, because it is ambiguous.
 *    {...x, ...l} // Statically a set, runtime error when spreading x.
 *    {...x, ...m} // Statically a map, no runtime error.
 *    {...l, ...m} // Static error, because it must be both a set and a map.
 * @description Checks that for [dynamic x] [{...x}] is a static error
