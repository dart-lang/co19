/// @assertion We define shape to mean the number of positional fields (the
/// record's arity) and the set of names of its named fields. Record types are
/// structural, not nominal. Records produced in unrelated libraries have the
/// exact same static type if they have the same shape and their corresponding
/// fields have the same types.
///
/// The order of named fields is not significant. The record types {int a,
/// int b} and {int b, int a} are identical to the type system and the runtime.
/// (Tools may or may not display them to users in a canonical form similar to
/// how they handle function typedefs.)
///
/// @description Checks that records produced in unrelated libraries have the
/// exact same static type if they have the same shape and their corresponding
/// fields have the same types.
