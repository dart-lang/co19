/// @assertion A mixin class declaration has Object from dart:core as superclass
/// iff itâ€™s either:
/// ...
/// - A mixin application class declaration where the declared superclass is the
///   Object class from dart:core, and which has precisely one declared mixin.
///   E.g., mixin class C = Object with M;
/// - A non-mixin-application class declaration with no declared mixins, and
///   either no declared superclass, or with a type denoting Object from
///   dart:core as the declared superclass. E.g., mixin class C {} or
///   mixin class C extends Object {}
/// The mixin class declarations can also have interfaces, type parameters, and
/// modifiers, but no extends or with clauses other than those shown here.

/// @description Check that it is not an error to declare a
