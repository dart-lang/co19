/// @assertion An instance field is promotable if all the following conditions
/// hold:
/// - It refers to a field (not a getter)
/// - The field is private
/// - The field is final
/// - There is no getter with the same name elsewhere in the library
/// - There is no non-final field with the same name elsewhere in the library
/// - There is no implicit noSuchMethod forwarder with the same name elsewhere
///   in the library.
///
/// @description Checks that if there are other concrete class instance getters
/// with the same name in the same library and they are not a final fields then
/// the field is not promotable. Test the case when there is a member with the
/// same name in some extension type in the same library. In this case promotion
/// is allowed
