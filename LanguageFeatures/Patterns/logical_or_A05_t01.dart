/// @assertion logicalOrPattern ::= ( logicalOrPattern '|' )? logicalAndPattern
///
/// A pair of patterns separated by | matches if either of the branches match
///
/// A logical-or pattern may match even if one of its branches does not. That
/// means that any variables in the non-matching branch would not be
/// initialized. To avoid problems stemming from that, the following
/// restrictions apply:
///
/// The two branches must define the same set of variables.
///
/// If the left branch matches, the right branch is not evaluated. This
/// determines which value the variable gets if both branches would have
/// matched. In that case, it will always be the value from the left branch.
