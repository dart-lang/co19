/// The body is a series of cases. Each case has a pattern, optional guard, and

/// of subelements (argument lists, collection literals), the cases are
/// separated by commas with an optional trailing comma. Since the body of each
/// case is a single expression with a known terminator, it's easy to tell when
/// one case ends and the next begins. That lets us do away with the case
/// keyword.
///
/// To keep the syntax small and light, we also disallow a default clause.
/// Instead, you can use a shorter _ wildcard pattern to catch any remaining
/// values.
///
/// Slotting into primary means it can be used anywhere any expression can
/// appear, even as operands to unary and binary operators. Many of these uses
/// are ugly, but not any more problematic than using a collection literal in
/// the same context since a switch expression is always delimited by a switch
/// and }.
