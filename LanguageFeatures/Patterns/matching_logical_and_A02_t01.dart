/// @assertion At runtime, a pattern is matched against a value. This determines
/// whether or not the match fails and the pattern refutes the value. If the
/// match succeeds, the pattern may also destructure data from the object or
/// bind variables.
///
/// Refutable patterns usually occur in a context where match refutation causes
/// execution to skip over the body of code where any variables bound by the
/// pattern are in scope. If a pattern match failure occurs in an irrefutable
/// context, a runtime error is thrown.
///
/// To match a pattern p against a value v:
/// ...
/// Logical-and:
/// i. Match the left subpattern against v. If the match fails, the logical-and
///   match fails.
/// ii. Otherwise, match the right subpattern against v and succeed if it
///   matches.
