/// @assertion logicalOrPattern ::= ( logicalOrPattern '||' )? logicalAndPattern
///
/// A pair of patterns separated by || matches if either of the branches match
///
/// A logical-or pattern may match even if one of its branches does not. That
/// means that any variables in the non-matching branch would not be
/// initialized. To avoid problems stemming from that, the following
/// restrictions apply:
///
/// The two branches must define the same set of variables.
///
/// If the left branch matches, the right branch is not evaluated. This
/// determines which value the variable gets if both branches would have
/// matched. In that case, it will always be the value from the left branch.
///
/// @description Checks that if the left branch doesn't match, then the right
/// branch is evaluated. Test switch expression
