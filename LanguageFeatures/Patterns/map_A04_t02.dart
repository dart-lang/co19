/// A map pattern matches values that implement Map and accesses values by key
/// from it.
///
/// It is a compile-time error if:
///
/// typeArguments is present and there are more or fewer than two type arguments
///
/// Any of the entry key expressions are not constant expressions.
///
/// If any two keys in the map are identical. Map patterns that don't have a
/// rest element only match if the length of the map is equal to the number of
/// map entries. If a map pattern has multiple identical key entries, they will
/// increase the required length for the pattern to match but in all but the
/// most perverse Map implementations will represent the same key. Thus, it's
/// very unlikely that any map pattern containing identical keys (and no rest
/// element) will ever match. Duplicate keys are most likely a typo in the code.
///
/// Any two record keys which both have primitive == are equal. Since records
/// don't have defined identity, we can't use the previous rule to detect
/// identical records. But records do support an equality test known at compile
/// time if all of their fields do, so we use that.
///
/// There is more than one ... element in the map pattern.
///
/// The ... element is not the last element in the map pattern.
