/// @assertion The variables defined by a pattern and its subpatterns (its
/// pattern variable set, defined above), are introduced into a scope based on
/// where the pattern appears:
/// ...
/// Pattern-for statement: Scoping follows the normal for and for-in statement
/// scoping rules where the variable (now variables) are bound in a new scope
/// for each loop iteration. All pattern variables are in the same scope. They
/// are considered initialized after the for loop initializer expression.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to refer to the variable
/// declared by the pattern in a pattern-for statement outside of its scope
