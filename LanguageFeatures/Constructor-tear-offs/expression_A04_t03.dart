/// @assertion For an expression of the form e<typeArgs>, which is not followed
/// by an argument list (that would turn it into a generic function invocation),
/// the meaning of e<typeArgs> depends on the expression e:
/// ...
/// - If e has a static type which is a generic callable object type (a
/// non-function type with a generic method named call), then e<typeArgs> is
/// equivalent to the instantiated method-tear off e.call<typeArgs>.
///
/// @description Checks that if e denotes a generic instance method then then
/// e<typeArgs> performs an explicitly instantiated method tear-off
