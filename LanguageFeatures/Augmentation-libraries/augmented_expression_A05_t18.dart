/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// ...
/// - Augmenting operators: When augmenting an operator, augmented refers to the
///   augmented operator method, which must be immediately invoked using
///   function call syntax. For example when augmenting `operator +` you would
///   use `augmented(1)` to call the augmented operator, and when augmenting
///   `operator []=` you would use the `augmented(key, value)` syntax.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to call a function which
/// has a named formal parameter with the name `augmented` in an augmenting
/// operator body.
