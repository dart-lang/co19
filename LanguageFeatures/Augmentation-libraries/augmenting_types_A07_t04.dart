/// @assertion A class, enum, extension type, mixin, or mixin class augmentation
/// may specify `extends`, `implements` and `with` clauses (when generally
/// supported). The types in these clauses are appended to the introductory
/// declarationsâ€™ clauses of the same kind, and if that clause did not exist
/// previously, then it is added with the new types. All regular rules apply
/// after this appending process, so you cannot have multiple `extends` on a
/// class, or an `on` clause on an enum, etc.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if a class, mixin or
/// enum augment specifies a base class in an `implements` clause
