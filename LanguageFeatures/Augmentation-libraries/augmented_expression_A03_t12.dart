/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// ...
/// - Augmenting fields: Within an augmenting field, augmented can only be used
///   in an initializer expression, and refers to the original field's
///   initializer expression, which is immediately evaluated.
///
/// It is a compile-time error to use `augmented` in an augmenting field's
/// initializer if the member being augmented is not a field with an initializer
///
/// @description Checks that within an augmenting field `augmented` invokes the
/// original field's initializer expression. Test late variables.
