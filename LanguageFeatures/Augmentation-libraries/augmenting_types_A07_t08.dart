/// @assertion A class, enum, extension type, or mixin augmentation may specify
/// extends, implements, on, and with clauses (when generally supported). The
/// types in these clauses are appended to the original declarations clauses of
/// the same kind, and if that clause did not exist previously then it is added
/// with the new types. All regular rules apply after this appending process, so
/// you cannot have multiple extends on a class, or an on clause on an enum, etc
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if a class, mixin or
/// enum augment specifies an interface in an `implements` clause which is not
/// compatible with existing interfaces
