/// @assertion An augmentation declaration `D` is a declaration marked with the
/// built-in identifier `augment`. We add `augment` as a built-in identifier as
/// a language versioned change, to avoid breaking pre-feature code.
///
/// `D` augments a declaration `I` with the same name and in the same
/// augmentation context as `D`. There may be multiple augmentations in the
/// augmentation context of `D`. More precisely, `I` is the declaration before
/// `D` and after every other declaration before `D`.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if an augmenting
/// declaration appears before the introductory one. Test augmenting declaration
/// in a main library.
