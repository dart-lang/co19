/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// - Augmenting getters: Within an augmenting getter `augmented` invokes the
///   augmented getter and evaluates to its return value. If augmenting a
///   variable with a getter, this will invoke the implicitly induced getter
///   from the augmented variable declaration.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to augment a getter
/// whose name is `augmented`.
