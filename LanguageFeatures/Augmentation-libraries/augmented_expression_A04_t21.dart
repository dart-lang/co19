/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// ...
/// - Augmenting functions: When augmenting a function, `augmented` refers to
///   the augmented function. Tear offs are not allowed, so this function must
///   immediately be invoked.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to use a type whose name
/// is `augmented` in an augmenting function return type.
