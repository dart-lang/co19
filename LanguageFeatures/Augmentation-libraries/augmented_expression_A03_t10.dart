/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// ...
/// - Augmenting fields: Within an augmenting field, augmented can only be used
///   in an initializer expression, and refers to the original field's
///   initializer expression, which is immediately evaluated.
///
/// If augmented refers to a variable declaration (as defined by a declaration
/// and a number of prior augmentations) with no initializer expression, and the
/// variable's type is nullable, augmented evaluates to null. If the variable's
/// type is not nullable, then it's a compile-time error.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to use `augmented` in an
/// augmenting field's initializer if the member being augmented is not a field
/// with an initializer and the variable's type is not-nullable
