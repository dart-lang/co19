/// @assertion The exact result of an `augmented` expression depends on what is
/// being augmented, but it generally follows the same rules as any normal
/// identifier:
/// ...
/// - Augmenting fields: Within an augmenting variable declaration, `augmented`
///   can only be used in an initializer expression, and refers to the augmented
///   variable's initializing expression, which is immediately evaluated.
///
/// It is a compile-time error to use `augmented` in an augmenting variable's
/// initializer if the member being augmented is not a variable declaration with
/// an initializing expression.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if an augmenting field
/// has a type whose name is `augmented`.
