/// @assertion For purposes of augmentation, a variable declaration is treated
/// as implicitly defining a getter whose return type is the type of the
/// variable. If the variable is not final, or is late without an initializer,
/// then the variable declaration also implicitly defines a setter with a
/// parameter named `_` whose type is the type of the variable.
///
/// If the variable is abstract, then the getter and setter are incomplete,
/// otherwise they are complete. For non-abstract variables, the compiler
/// synthesizes a getter that accesses the backing storage and a setter that
/// updates it, so these members have bodies.
///
/// A getter can be augmented by another getter, and likewise a setter can be
/// augmented by a setter. This is true whether the getter or setter is
/// explicitly declared or implicitly declared using a variable declaration.
///
/// @description Checks that a getter may be augmented by an implicitly defined
/// augmenting getter (abstract variable).
