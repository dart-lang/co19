/// @assertion Itâ€™s currently a compile-time error for a class to implement,
/// extend or mix-in the Enum class.
///
/// Because we want to allow interfaces and mixins that are intended to be
/// applied to enum declarations, and therefore to assume Enum to be a
/// superclass, we loosen that restriction to:
///
/// It's a compile-time error if a concrete class has Enum as a superinterface
/// (directly or transitively) unless it is the corresponding class of an enum
/// declaration. (Abstract interfaces and mixins implementing Enum are allowed,
/// but only so that they can be used by enum declarations, they can never be
/// used to create an instance which implements Enum, but which is not an enum
/// value.)
///
/// @description Check that implicit class of enum declaration implements Enum
