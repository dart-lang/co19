/// @assertion Itâ€™s currently a compile-time error for a class to implement,
/// extend or mix-in the Enum class.
///
/// Because we want to allow interfaces and mixins that are intended to be
/// applied to enum declarations, and therefore to assume Enum to be a
/// superclass, we loosen that restriction to:
/// ...
/// It's a compile-time error if a class or mixin declaration has `Enum` as a
/// superinterface and the interface of the declarations contains an instance
/// member with the name `values`, whether declared or inherited. If any
/// concrete class implements this interface, it will be an enum declaration
/// class, and then the `values` member would conflict with the static `values`
/// constant getter that is automatically added to enum declaration classes.
/// Such an instance `values` declaration is either useless or wrong, so we
/// disallow it entirely.
///
/// @description Check that it's a compile-time error if a class has Enum as a
/// superinterface and the interface of the declarations contains an instance
/// member with the name values
