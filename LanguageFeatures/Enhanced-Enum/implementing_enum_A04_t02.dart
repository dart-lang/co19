/// @assertion Itâ€™s currently a compile-time error for a class to implement,
/// extend or mix-in the Enum class.
///
/// Because we want to allow interfaces and mixins that are intended to be
/// applied to enum declarations, and therefore to assume Enum to be a
/// superclass, we loosen that restriction to:
/// ...
/// It's a compile-time error if a class or mixin declaration has Enum as a
/// superinterface, and that class or mixin declares or inherits a concrete
/// instance member named `index`, `hashCode` or `==` (an `operator ==`
/// declaration). That `index` member could override the `index` getter
/// inherited from `Enum`, and we currently do not allow that. The `hashCode`
/// and `operator ==` declarations would prevent the enum class from having
/// "primitive equality", and we want to ensure that enums can be used in
/// switches.
///
/// @description Check that it's a compile-time error if a class declaration has
/// Enum as a superinterface, and it declares a non-abstract instance member
/// named `index`.
