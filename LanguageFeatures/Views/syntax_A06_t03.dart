/// @assertion A rule for <viewDeclaration> is added to the grammar, along with
/// some rules for elements used in view declarations:
///
/// <viewDeclaration> ::=
///   'view' 'class' <typeIdentifier> <typeParameters>?
///       <viewPrimaryConstructor>?
///       <interfaces>?
///   '{'
///     (<metadata> <viewMemberDeclaration>)*
///   '}'
///
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> ::=
///   '(' <type> <identifier> ')'
///
/// <viewMemberDeclaration> ::=
///   <classMemberDefinition>
/// ...
/// A compile-time error occurs if a view declaration declares an abstract
/// member. A compile-time error occurs if a view declaration has a
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> and declares an instance variable. Finally, a
/// compile-time error occurs if a view does not have a
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor>, and it does not declare an instance variable, or
/// it declares more than one instance variable.
///
/// @description Checks that it is no compile-time error if a view declaration
/// has no <viewPrimaryConstructor> and declares a final instance variable and
/// no constructor or a constructor, as long as the variable is initialised
