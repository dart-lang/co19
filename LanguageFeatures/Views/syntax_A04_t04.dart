/// @assertion A rule for <viewDeclaration> is added to the grammar, along with
/// some rules for elements used in view declarations:
///
/// <viewDeclaration> ::=
///   'view' 'class' <typeIdentifier> <typeParameters>?
///       <viewPrimaryConstructor>?
///       <interfaces>?
///   '{'
///     (<metadata> <viewMemberDeclaration>)*
///   '}'
///
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> ::=
///   '(' <type> <identifier> ')'
///
/// <viewMemberDeclaration> ::=
///   <classMemberDefinition>
/// ...
/// The name of the representation in a view declaration that includes a
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> is the identifier id specified in there, and the
/// type of the representation is the declared type of id.
///
/// @description Checks runtime type and values of a view
