/// @assertion A rule for <viewDeclaration> is added to the grammar, along with
/// some rules for elements used in view declarations:
///
/// <viewDeclaration> ::=
///   'view' 'class' <typeIdentifier> <typeParameters>?
///       <viewPrimaryConstructor>?
///       <interfaces>?
///   '{'
///     (<metadata> <viewMemberDeclaration>)*
///   '}'
///
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> ::=
///   '(' <type> <identifier> ')'
///
/// <viewMemberDeclaration> ::=
///   <classMemberDefinition>
/// ...
/// If a view declaration named View includes a <viewPrimaryConstructor> then it
/// is a compile-time error if the declaration includes a constructor
/// declaration named View. (But it can still contain other constructors.)
///
/// @description Checks that if a view declaration named `View` includes a
/// <viewPrimaryConstructor> then it can contain other (than named `View`)
/// constructors
