/**
 * @assertion Any expression of the form e1(args) or e1<types>(args) where e1
 * does not denote a method, and where the static type of e1 is not a function
 * type, an interface type declaring a call method, or dynamic, will currently
 * be a compile-time error. If the static type of e1 is an interface type
 * declaring a call getter, then this stays a compile-time error. Otherwise we
 * check for extensions applying to the static type of e1 and declaring a call
 * member. If one such most specific extension exists, and it declares a call
 * extension method, then the expression is equivalent to e1.call(args) or
 * e1.call<typeS>(args). Otherwise it is still a compile-time error.
 *
 * @description Check that it is a compile error if there is e1 is an interface
 * with 'call' getter
