/// @assertion It is a compile-time error if an extension application occurs in a
/// place where it is not the target expression of a simple or composite member
/// invocation. That is, the only valid use of an extension application is to
/// invoke members on it. This is similar to how prefix names can also only be
/// used as member invocation targets. The main difference is that extensions can
/// also declare operators.

/// @description Check that it is no compile-time error if null-aware member
