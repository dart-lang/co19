/// @assertion For any member access, x.foo, x.bar(), x.baz = 42, x(42),
/// x[0] = 1 or x + y, including null-aware and cascade accesses which
/// effectively desugar to one of those direct accesses, and including implicit
/// member accesses on this, the language first checks whether the static type
/// of x has a member with the same base name as the operation. That is, if it
/// has a corresponding instance member, respectively, a foo method or getter or
/// a foo= setter, a bar member or bar= setter, a baz member or baz= setter, a
/// call method, a []= operator or a + operator. If so, then the operation is
/// unaffected by extensions. This check does not care whether the invocation is
/// otherwise correct, based on number or type of the arguments, it only checks
/// whether there is a member at all.
///
/// @description Check that an instance member takes a precedence over an
/// extension member and it's never mind if the invocation is otherwise correct,
/// based on number or type of the arguments, it only checks whether there is a
