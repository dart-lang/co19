/**
 * @assertion An expression of the form [MyList(object)] or
 * [MyList<String>(object)] must only be used for extension member access. It is
 * a compile-time error to use it in any other way, similarly to how it is a
 * compile-time error to use a prefix for anything other than member access.
 * This also means that you cannot use an override expression as the receiver of
 * a cascade, because a cascade does evaluate its receiver to a value, or of an
 * assigning operator like += or ++. Unlike a prefix, it doesn't have to be
 * followed by a [.] because extensions can also declare operators, but it must
 * be followed by a [.], a declared operator, or an arguments part (in case the
 * extension implements call).
 * @description Check that overriding extensions can be used without member
 * access call.
