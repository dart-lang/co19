/// @assertion When inferring types for a `const .id(arguments)` or

/// denoted by the shorthand context assigned to the `<staticMemberShorthand>`,
/// which may differ from C. Then proceed with type inference in the same way as

/// D. It’s a compile-time error if the shorthand context does not denote a
