/// @assertion A postfix expression expression can follow a `?` in a conditional
/// expression, as in `{e1 ? . id : e2}`. This is not ambiguous with `e1?.id`
/// since we parse `?.` as a single token, and will keep doing so. It does mean
/// that `{e1?.id:e2}` and `{e1? .id:e2}` will now both be valid and have
/// different meanings, where the existing grammar didnâ€™t allow the `?` token to
/// be followed by `.` anywhere.
///
/// @description Checks that `{e1? .id:e2}` is parsed like a set literal.
