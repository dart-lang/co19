/// @assertion Dart semantics, static and dynamic, do not follow the grammar
/// precisely. For example, a static member invocation expression of the form
/// `C.id<T1>(e2)` is treated as an atomic entity for type inference (and
/// runtime semantics). Itâ€™s not a combination of doing a `C.id` tear-off, then
/// a `<T1>` instantiation and then an `(e2)` invocation. The context type of
/// that entire expression is used throughout the inference, where
/// `(e1.id<T1>)(e2)` has `(e1.id<T1>)` in a position where it has no context
/// type.
///
/// Because of that, the specification of the static and runtime semantics of
/// the new constructs needs to address all the forms `.id`, `.id<typeArgs>`,
/// `.id(args)`, `.id<typeArgs>(args)`, `.new` or `.new(args)`.
/// ...
/// The general rule is that any of the expression forms above, starting with
/// `.id`, are treated exactly as if they were preceded by a fresh prefixed
/// identifier `_p.C` which denotes the declaration of the type of the context
/// type scheme of the entire `<staticMemberShorthand>`.
///
/// @description Checks that the processing of the context type for shorthand
/// of the forms `.id`, `.id(args)` and `.id<typeArgs>(args)` includes a type
/// alias expansion. Test prefixed import.
