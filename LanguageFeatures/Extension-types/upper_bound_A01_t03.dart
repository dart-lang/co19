/// @assertion The Dart 1 algorithm which is used to compute the standard upper
/// bound of two distinct interface types will work in the same way as it does
/// today, albeit on a slightly different superinterface graph:
///
/// For the purpose of this algorithm, we consider `Object?` to be a
/// superinterface of `Null` and `Object`, and the path lengths mentioned in the
/// algorithm will increase by one (because they start from `Object?` rather
/// than from `Object`).
///
/// @description Check that the least upper bound calculation algorithm for
/// non-nullable types starts superinterfaces tree from `Object`
