/// @assertion Consider an invocation of the extension type member m on the
/// receiver expression e according to the extension type declaration V with the
/// actual type arguments T1, ..., Ts. If the invocation includes an actual
/// argument part (possibly including some actual type arguments) then call it
/// args. If the invocation does not include an actual argument part, but it
/// does include a list of actual type arguments, call it typeArgs. Finally,
/// assume that V declares the type variables X1, ..., Xs.
///
/// Note that if the name of m is a name in the interface of Object (that is,
/// toString, ==, hashCode, runtimeType, or noSuchMethod), the denoted member is
/// necessarily a non-extension type member, which determines the static
/// analysis and dynamic semantics.

/// @description Checks that members of an `Object` are treated as all other
/// non-extension type members. Check `toString()`
