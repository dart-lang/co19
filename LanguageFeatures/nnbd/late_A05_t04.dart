/// @assertion A read of a field or variable which is marked as late which has
/// not yet been written to causes the initializer expression of the variable to
/// be evaluated to a value, assigned to the variable or field, and returned as
/// the value of the read.
/// ...
/// If a variable or field is read from during the process of evaluating its own
/// initializer expression, and no write to the variable has occurred, the read
/// is treated as a first read and the initializer expression is evaluated again.

/// @description Check that if a variable or field is read from during the
/// process of evaluating its own initializer expression but write to the
