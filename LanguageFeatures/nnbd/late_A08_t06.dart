/// @assertion A toplevel or static variable with an initializer is evaluated as

/// that:
///  - Throwing an exception during initializer evaluation no longer sets the
///    variable to null
///  - Reading the variable during initializer evaluation is no longer checked
///    for, and does not cause an error.
