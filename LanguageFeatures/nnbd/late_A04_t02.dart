/// @assertion A read of a field or variable which is marked as late which has
/// not yet been written to causes the initializer expression of the variable to
/// be evaluated to a value, assigned to the variable or field, and returned as
/// the value of the read.
/// ...
/// Evaluating the initializer expression may cause an exception to be thrown. If
/// the variable was written to before the exception was thrown, the value of the
/// variable on subsequent reads is the last written value. If the variable was
/// not written before the exception was thrown, then the next read attempts to
/// evaluate the initializer expression again.
///
/// @description Check that if evaluating of the initializer expression throws an
/// exception then the value of the variable is the last written value
