/// @assertion A read of a field or variable which is marked as late which has
/// not yet been written to causes the initializer expression of the variable to
/// be evaluated to a value, assigned to the variable or field, and returned as
/// the value of the read.
/// ...
/// Evaluating the initializer expression may validly cause a write to the field
/// or variable, assuming that the field or variable is not final. In this case,
/// the variable assumes the written value. The final value of the initializer
/// expression overwrites any intermediate written values.

/// @description Check that it is a runtime error if initializing expression
/// writes an intermediate value to final field or variable
