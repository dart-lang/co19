/// @assertion The flatten function is modified as follows:
///
/// [flatten(T)] is defined by cases on [T]:
///
///   if [T] is [S?] then [flatten(T) = flatten(S)?]
///   otherwise if [T] is [S*] then [flatten(T) = flatten(S)*]
///   otherwise if [T] is [FutureOr<S>] then [flatten(T) = S]
///   otherwise [if T <: Future] then let [S] be a type such that [T <:
///       Future<S>] and for all [R], if [T <: Future<R>] then [S <: R]; then
///       [flatten(T) = S]
///   otherwise [flatten(T) = T]
///
/// @description Check that future flattening works correctly for
/// [Future<dynamic>] type and the expression can be null.
///
/// Issue 41437
