/// @assertion The default bound of generic type parameters is treated as
/// [Object?].
///
/// @description It seems like it is not possible to obtain the value of the
/// default bound at runtime, we can only obtain the result of instantiation to
/// bound. So the test checks that if generic class type parameter is not clearly
/// specified, it is treated as [dynamic] at runtime.
/// See also co19 issue #530.
