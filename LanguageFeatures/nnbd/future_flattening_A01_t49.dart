 * @assertion The flatten function is modified as follows:
 *
 * [flatten(T)] is defined by cases on [T]:
 *
 *   if [T] is [S?] then [flatten(T) = flatten(S)?]
 *   otherwise if [T] is [S*] then [flatten(T) = flatten(S)*]
 *   otherwise if [T] is [FutureOr<S>] then [flatten(T) = S]
 *   otherwise [if T <: Future] then let [S] be a type such that [T <:
 *       Future<S>] and for all [R], if [T <: Future<R>] then [S <: R]; then
 *       [flatten(T) = S]
 *   otherwise [flatten(T) = T]
 *
 * @description Check that type of await expression match with expected
 * [FutureOr<void>] type and the expression can be null.
