/// @assertion Let C be a non-redirecting generative constructor with, implicit
/// or explicit, super-constructor invocation s at the end of its initializer
/// list. Let D be the superclass constructor targeted by s (which must exist).
///
/// We define the associated super-constructor parameter for each
/// super-parameter p of C as follows:
///
/// If p is a positional parameter, let j be the number of positional
/// super-parameters of C up to and including p in source order. The associated
/// super-constructor parameter of p is the jth positional parameter of D
/// (1-based), if D has that many positional parameters.
/// If p is a named parameter with name n, the associated super-constructor
/// parameter is the named parameter of D with name n, if D has a named
/// parameter with that name.
///
/// Itâ€™s a compile-time error if a non-redirecting generative
/// constructor has a super-parameter with no associated super-constructor
/// parameter.

/// @description Check that it is a compile-time error if a non-redirecting
/// generative constructor has a super-parameter with no associated
/// super-constructor parameter.
