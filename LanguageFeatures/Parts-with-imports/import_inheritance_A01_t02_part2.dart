/// imports cannot break your code (at least if you’re not depending on them). A
/// part file is never restricted by the imports it inherits from its parent
/// file. It can ignore and override all of them with imports of its own. That
/// allows a file, like a macro generated file, to import all its own
/// dependencies and be completely self-contained when it comes to imports.
///
/// @description Check that for the part file may import its own copy of the
/// library already imported by the parent.
