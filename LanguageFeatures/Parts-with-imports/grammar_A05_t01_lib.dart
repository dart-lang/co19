/// @assertion We extend the grammar of part files to allow import, export and
/// part file directives. We allow part files directives to use a configurable
/// URI like the other two. We restrict the part of directive to only allow the
/// string version.
///
/// -- Changed "<uri>" to "<configurableUri>".
/// <partDirective> ::= <metadata> `part' <configurableUri> `;'
///
/// -- Removed "<dottedIdentifier>" as option, retaining only "<uri>".
/// <partHeader> ::= <metadata> `part' `of' <uri> `;'
///
/// -- Added "<importOrExport>* <partDirective>*"
/// <partDeclaration> ::=
///   <partHeader> <importOrExport>* <partDirective>*
///   (<metadata> <topLevelDeclaration>)* <EOF>
///
/// The grammar change is small, mainly adding import, export and part
/// directives to part files.
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if a part file contains
/// an unnamed library directive.
