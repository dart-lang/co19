/// @assertion The unit of ownership is the library. Itâ€™s quite possible for one
/// part file to introduce a conflict with another part file. It always was, but
/// there are new ways too. If that happens, the library owner, who most likely
/// introduced the problem, is expected to fix it. There is no attempt to hide
/// name conflicts between declarations in separate tree-branches of the library
/// structure.
///
/// @description Check that it is a compile-time error if different part files
/// have non-augmenting declarations with the same name.
