/// @assertion Letâ€™s introduce importsOf(S), where S is a set of `import`
/// directives from a single Dart file, to refer to that computation, which
/// introduces a scope containing the declarations introduced by all the
/// `import`s (the declarations of the export scope of each imported library,
/// minus those hidden by a `show` or `hide` operator, combined such that a name
/// conflicts of different declarations is not an error, but the name is marked
/// as conflicted in the scope, and then referencing it is an error.)
///
/// @description Check that it is a compile-time error to access re-exported
/// members hidden by implicit `hide` and `show`.
