/// @assertion Let P be a prefix scope containing all the import prefixes
/// declared by the current file. The parent scope of P is I.
/// ...
/// - If Pname is not `deferred`, and the parent scope in C has a non-deferred
///   prefix import scope with the same name, Cname, then the parent scope of
///   Pname is Cname. A part file can use the same prefix as a prefix that it
///   inherits, because inherited imports are only suggestions. If it adds to
///   that import scope, by importing into it, that can shadow existing
///   declarations, just like in the top-level declaration scope. A deferred
///   prefix import scope cannot be extended, and cannot extend another prefix
///   scope, deferred prefix scopes are always linked to a single import
///   directive.
///
/// @description Check that a part file can use the same prefix as a prefix that
/// it inherits. In this case it shadows inherited declarations.
