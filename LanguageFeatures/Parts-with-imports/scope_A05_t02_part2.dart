/// @assertion Let `P`, the combined import scope of `F`, be a scope with `I` as
/// enclosing scope and a namespace containing every import prefix declared by
/// an import declaration of `F`.
/// ...
/// - If an import is `deferred`, its `Pname` is a deferred scope which has an
///   extra `loadLibrary` member added, and the import implicitly hides any
///   member named loadLibrary in the (singular) imported library's export scope
///   (as usual).
///
/// @description Check that if an import is deferred an extra `loadLibrary`
/// member is added and it can be a runtime error to access any of its members
/// before `loadLibrary()` completes successfully. Test the case when
/// `loadLibrary()` is called from another part file.
