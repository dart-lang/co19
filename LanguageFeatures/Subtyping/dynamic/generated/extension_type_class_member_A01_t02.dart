/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written
/// T0 <: T1) when:
/// Assume that T1, .. Ts are types, and V resolves to an extension type
/// declaration of the following form:
///
/// extension type V<X1 extends B1, .. Xs extends Bs>(T id) ... {
///   ... // Members.
/// }
/// It is then allowed to use V<T1, .. Tk> as a type.
///
/// @description Check that if type `T0` is an extension type `V<T1, .. Ts>` and
/// `T1` is an extension type `V<X1, .. Ss>` then `T0` is a subtype of `T1` if
/// all `Ti <: Xi`
/// @author sgrekhov22@gmail.com
///
/// @description Check that if type T0 is a subtype of a type T1, then instance
/// of T0 can be assigned to the superclass member of type T1
