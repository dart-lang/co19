/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written T0 <: T1)
/// when:
/// Right Object: if T1 is Object then:
///  - if T0 is an unpromoted type variable with bound B then T0 <: T1 iff
///      B <: Object
///  - if T0 is a promoted type variable X & S then T0 <: T1 iff S <: Object
///  - if T0 is FutureOr<S> for some S, then T0 <: T1 iff S <: Object.
///  - if T0 is S* for any S, then T0 <: T1 iff S <: T1
///  - if T0 is Null, dynamic, void, or S? for any S, then the subtyping does not
///      hold (per above, the result of the subtyping query is false).
///  - Otherwise T0 <: T1 is true.
