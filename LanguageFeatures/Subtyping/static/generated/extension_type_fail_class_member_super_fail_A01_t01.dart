/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written
/// T0 <: T1) when:
/// Assume that T1, .. Ts are types, and V resolves to an extension type
/// declaration of the following form:
///
/// extension type V<X1 extends B1, .. Xs extends Bs>(T id) ... {
///   ... // Members.
/// }
/// It is then allowed to use V<T1, .. Tk> as a type.
///
/// @description Check that if a type `T0` is an extension type `V<T1, .. Ts>`
/// and `T1` is an extension type `V<X1, .. Ss>` and there is `i` such that `Ti`
/// is not a subtype of `Xi` then `T0` is not a subtype of `T1`
/// @author sgrekhov22@gmail.com
///
/// @description Check that if type T0 is not a subtype of a type T1, then
/// instance of T0 cannot be assigned to the superclass member of type T1.
/// Assignment to variable of super class is tested.
