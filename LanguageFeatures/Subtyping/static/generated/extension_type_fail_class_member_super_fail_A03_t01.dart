/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written

/// Here is an overview of the subtype relationships of an extension type V0

/// types V1 .. Vk, as well as other typing relationships involving V0

/// V0 is a proper subtype of each of V1 .. Vk

/// @description Check that if a type `T1` is an extension type `V0`
